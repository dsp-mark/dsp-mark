### Hey, I'm Mark (they/them)!

------------------------

I'm a **former data and machine learning engineer** in the process of pivoting into something a bit more solid.

For a while, I was a **TA and tutor for data analytics/machine learning and full stack web programs** (at University of Toronto and remote). It was a cool experience and I was lucky enough to watch cool people grow into their abilities and find their place in industry. 

These days I'm working on **sounding rocket and robotics projects** while preparing to apply to PhD programs. I do a lot of **LiDAR**, **Stereovision**, and **Robotic navigation**. 

I'm particularly interested in **multi-agent systems** of every sort since I strongly believe that **knowledge is a shared/social property**, a conviction I latched onto while studying **Epistemology and Philosophy of Mind** as the focus for my **Bachelors in Philosophy.** 

Mostly, I just like designing, researching, and implementing cool stuff, so my interests and skills are all over the place.

**Thanks for stopping by!**

------------------------

**Current interests:** Aerospace engineering, autonomous systems, deep reinforcement learning, electrical engineering, self-supervised learning, photonics, optics, robotics, RF, and statistics.

------------------------

**Why "DSP" Mark?** Digital Signal Processing has always fascinated me and I've always wanted to spend more time in the field. I just haven't gotten the chance yet. Still need to buff up my skills a bit before I can have a formal opportunity.

**Why so many repos with commits from de-mark?** That's my former account from when I was tutoring and TA-ing. I transferred the code I had the best memories of before switching over to this account.
